## Project Overview
First, we extract the titles from the target sports boards on PTT along with various indicators and the average traffic of PTT boards. After formatting and processing the data, we use the HP filter to remove long-term trends. Then, we analyze the data using various econometric and statistical methods. Finally, we create charts and interpret and discuss the results.
